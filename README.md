# SleepAI

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

This project is about using the power of AI and combining it with the data from modern devices like FitBits, Smartphones, Smartwatches, etc. Maximising the quality and quantity of sleep by considering important parameters and processing them with AI is the goal of SleepAI.


## Background

Probably everyone experienced the fact that the quality and the quantity of sleep is varying from day to day and it depends on many different parameters.
I experienced a huge difference in the quality of my sleep depending on various parameters like the time i went to bed, the lenght of my sleep and if my day was exhausting or not. But also with most of the parameters I can evaluate, I experienced a difference in the feeling after waking up. It varies from fit and instantly awake to tired and snoozing as long as possible. With SleepAI I want to build the perfect sleep schedule to maximise the days where you wake up fit and motivated.


## How is it used?

The AI probably works best when implemented into an App that is connected to the data sources like smartwatches, smartphones or alarm clocks.
Through this sources information can be combined to compute the amount of sleep that is needed and when a user should start his sleep. Then the app recognises the timepoint when the user really sleeps. Knowing the amount of sleep that is needed a good time point to wake up is calculated. Through monitoring the sleep the time point of waking up the user can be adjusted live. Therefore parameters like sleep phases (REM etc.) can be evaluated. Taking into account user experiences the app should individualize itself for a even better experience. 


## Data sources and AI methods

Data are gathered from the smartphone of the user and enriched by live data from the smartwatch. Over time the data is expanded by the experiences from the user by implementing the app in his daily life.

## Challenges

Many different subjects and areas have to be considered in order to deliver a app with a good user experience and a working algorithm.

## What next?

Through my mathematical Background I have most experience in creating, developing and implementing a algorithm. Help is needed in building a connection to the data sources of smartphones/smartwatches and building a user friendly app, because I am not really experienced in that area.
